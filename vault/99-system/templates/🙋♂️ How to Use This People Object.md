# 🙋♂️ How to Use This People Object

Welcome to your **People** object type!This object is designed to help you keep track of important people in your network—whether they're colleagues, clients, mentors, collaborators, or friends.

## 🔍 What Is a Person Object?

In Capacities, each person is treated as an individual **object**.This means:

- You can **link** people to meetings, organizations, projects, or notes related to them.

    - Don't worry about missing a connection; Capacities will find any unlinked mentions for you, so you can come back and make connections later.

- All your notes, insights, and interactions with that person stay attached to their profile.

- Your network becomes an interconnected web of meaningful relationships, easy to navigate and build upon.
