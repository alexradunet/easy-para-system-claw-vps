The **Project** object helps you plan, track progress, and document key insights for any project.

## 💡 How to Use Project Notes

### 1. **Define the Project**

Start by clarifying essential details:

- **Project Name** A clear and concise title.

- **Status:** Is the project in the planning stage, or has it begun?

- **Collaborators:** Link to the people you are working with to keep everything in context.

You could also state the project goal at the top of the page to always keep focus.

### 2. **Break Down Tasks & Milestones**

Organize the project into manageable steps:

- **Tasks:** List specific actions that need to be completed.

- **Milestones:** Define key progress points to track achievements.

- **Deadlines:** Assign due dates to keep the project on schedule.

### 3. **Document Key Decisions & Insights**

Capture important discussions, decisions, and lessons learned:

- **What was decided?**

- **Why was the decision made?**

- **Any challenges encountered?**

### 4. **Track Progress & Adjust Plans**

Regularly update your notes to reflect:

- Completed tasks ✅

- Roadblocks or delays ⚠️

- Adjustments to scope or timelines 🔄

### 5. **Link Related Notes & Resources**

Connect your project notes with relevant objects like **meetings or people** to maintain context and easy access to supporting information. You can add any of these elements as properties, so they show up across all of your project objects.

- Don't worry about missing a connection; Capacities will find any unlinked mentions for you, so you can come back and  make connections later.
